//This problem is the easiest one in codeforce (even my friend whoâ€™ve just learned cpp in 30 mins can do it), but since it took me 3 takes to be accepted, it will on this list;
// Problem: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A 
//Basically the problem goes like this:

// You have a number of kilos of a watermelon xd, 
// and you have to divine a watermelon into 2 parts, 
// but each part has even number of kilos. Your output could be YES if you can divine it and NO for otherwise.

// solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main () {
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    if (a > 2 and a <= 100) {
        if (a % 2 == 0)
            cout << "YES";
        else cout << "NO";
    }
    else cout << "NO";
return 0;
}

// ez as that!
